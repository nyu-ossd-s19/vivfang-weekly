## Open Source Meetup

This week I attended the OSI open source meetup and my first BUGS meeting. The meetup was focused around careers in open source which included everything from engineering to legal. I learned a lot about open source in the real world and all the different parts involved. I also got to hear a lot of different points of view on open source software and working in open source companies. Finally, I got to meet a lot of different people in a lot of different roles and have some interesting conversations about careers in open source.
