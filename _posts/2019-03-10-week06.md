I think humanitarian open source software is an awesome initiative and noble cause. I admire the developers who have come up with and worked on these projects. Although I would love to work on one day, I don't think I'd want to work on one anytime soon. As Chamindra de Silva said, HFOSS projects are mission critical. For disaster relief software, a bug could mean the difference between life or death. That's a huge responsibility for developers and it's not one that I personally feel ready to take on. Because of this, I think HFOSS projects are more difficult to contribute to and HFOSS communities might want to be more careful about screening contributors. However, I also think that contributing to an HFOSS project is more prestigious than any normal open source project. Although all projects should be benefitting someone, HFOSS projects are meant to help those most in need, or cannot help themselves. Contributing to a project like this not only shows what developers are capable of technically, but also what they value in their lives.
