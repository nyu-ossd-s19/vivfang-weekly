I chose the open source project React because it's a library that I've used a significant amount before. We work with it a little in AIT here at NYU, and I used it to build mobile apps that are compatible with both Android and iOS phones. I wanted to choose something that's widely used and appreciated, especially among other developrs. In addition, I knew this project is in Javascript which I have some experience with but would like to learn more. Finally, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this project is very active and the maintainers seem to be very responsive and helpful in discussions. All big decisions seem to be discussed, and almost every pull request and issue has some discussion, even if it is just a thank you for reporting the bug. Below you can find my project evaluation with more details on the project itself and activity within the project.
