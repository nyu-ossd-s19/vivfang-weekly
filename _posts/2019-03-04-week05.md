##Christos Bacharakis from Mozilla Foundation

I really admired the passion for open source software that Christos and the Mozilla Foundation have. I also found myself feeling less hesitant about open source software development when I heard Christos talking about how welcoming the communities he's worked with has been. Finally, I was excited to learn about the open source student network that Mozilla sponsors. I think it's a great way for computer science students to connect in the real world and learn important skills for our future careers. I also think it's a great testament to Mozilla's mission and their commitment to their mission. Mozilla's mission to build a better internet feels like a much needed positive presence in today's technological environment.

##Installing React

Last week I evaluated the repository for (react)[https://github.com/facebook/react], however I noticed that this repository had no documentation issues. Documentation for react is in the (reactjs repository)[https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org]. I forked, installed, and ran this repository which went very smoothly. I already had node and yarn installed so I may have avoided some issues there, but otherwise installing and running this project was very simple and well documented.
