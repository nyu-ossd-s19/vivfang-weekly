## Project Progress

This week I updated the references to React Native libraries in the examples Android gradle files and the Xcode project. I also added the babel-plugin-module-resolver modules and configured it correctly in babel.config.js. I then moved the native javscript code files, renaming them with an RNC (React Native Community) prefix instead of the old RCT. I placed the Javascript code in js and changed the index path in package.json. Finally I started working on cleaning up some of the Android Gradle files so that they match the other React Native Community components.
